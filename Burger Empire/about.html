                <h3>Oil quality control</h3>
                <p>We paid special attention to the quality of the oil used for frying side dishes in Burger Bars, using a unique device on the world market for filtering oil for frying VITO® and instruments for testing the quality of the oil, which is regularly changed accordingly. By using the VITO® device, the taste and quality of the food is improved, i.e., we serve our guests healthier deep-fried food that does not contain carbon, which is a product of the long-term use of frying oil. It has been proven that the use of VITO® devices has a positive effect on critical parameters such as Total Polar Matters - TPM.</p>
